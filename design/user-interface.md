# User Interface

THIS DRAFT VERSION IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND NOT YET AGREED UPON.

## User stories

### Play / move a card

Default / automatic card placement, or at least a grid.
A way to stack/attach cards easily.

### Card interaction

Using a radial menu.

### Toggle / target

An easy way to toggle or target a card (and log it).

### Torpor

The torpor is not a zone, it is handled with an overlay.
