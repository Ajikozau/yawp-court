Online play platform for Vampire: the Eternal Struggle

## Overall goal

The goal is to provide a new game platform under the following constraints:

- Free of charge and open source
- Real-time multiplayer games with cards images
- Stable, with server redundancy capabilities
- Usable for tournaments (play log and no secret shared)
- Compatible with all major operating systems and, ideally, mobile devices

## Design reference

The following documents are the design reference for this platform:

- [Architecture](design/architecture.md)
- [User interface](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a7di0kETXKSB9XYnHDqG_dQJS6kPjd_8SBE9eEdhBMo/edit?usp=sharing)

## Components

Some potentially useful [components](components/README.md) are available.

## Future goals

While not in the scope of our current target, these could be the next steps:

- Option for asynchronous play
- Tournament and event organisation platform (both online and offline)
- Mobile App
